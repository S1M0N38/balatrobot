# BalatroBot

> A bot framework for Balatro

BalatroBot is a Python framework for developing automated bots to play the card game Balatro.
The architecture consists of three main layers: a communication layer using TCP protocol with Lua API,
a Python framework layer for bot development, and comprehensive testing and documentation systems.
The project enables real-time bidirectional communication between the game and bot through TCP sockets.
